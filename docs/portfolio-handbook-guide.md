WE MADE THIS FOR YOU.
Creating a portfolio can be an immense undertaking. It requires a deep
understanding of yourself and reflection upon who you want to be. It not
only documents part of your past, but it’s built to forge a particular future.
As you sort through past projects, it’s a time of self-reflection. Strengths as well
as weaknesses become apparent. All the while, it makes your eyes widen as
you notice how much self-growth can happen from one project to the next.
This book was put together for the purpose of facilitating higher-quality
portfolios. It will not cover project processes, but will act as a guide to
documenting a project well for your portfolio. We hope the book will ease
some of the anxiety around creating your first portfolio and then later exist
as a helpful reference book to check a newer portfolio concept against.
It’s too subjective to say that there is any one-right way to create a portfo-
lio, just like there isn’t any one-right-process to design. Being fresh, sur-
prising, and creative is part of our job. Following this book may not lead
you to the most super-awesome portfolio of all time, but it will provide a
solid foundation on which to showcase your super-awesome designs.

00 KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE
kNOW YOUR AUDIENCE
Remember: your portfolio is not about you; it’s about what you can do
for an employer. As you’re creating your portfolio, ask yourself, “who
is my audience?” Are you applying to a corporation? A consultancy? A
toy company? Your portfolio should align to your employment goals.
We asked co-op employers to rate the skills they look for in students on
a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being of little importance and 10 being absolutely
imperative. According to the data, employers most value the quality of
ideas presented, followed by competency in conceptual sketching and
ideation. They cared least about graphic design sensitivity and skills in
the shop. Take these findings with a grain of salt: the designers we were
able to contact mostly worked at consultancies, and the data could
easily shift if the focus was placed in another area of the design world.
Prospective employers will not spend much time looking through your
portfolio. You’ll get just a few seconds of their time (seriously); you’ll only as
long as it takes to flip through the PDF you send them. Organize your work
so that your best project is the first project they see. You should also end your
portfolio on a high note. It’s important to learn to self-edit; don’t include
work that you aren’t confident in and aren’t comfortable talking about.

THE gOLD STANDARD FOR CREATINg YOUR pORTFOLIO
MASTER pAgES
Master pages are used to automatically
insert layout elements on various
pages. All elements of the master page
are placed onto any page you choose,
and these are by default not selectable
when you are working on individual
pages. This allows you to further
develop the page without worrying
about accidentally modifying the
pre-defi ned elements (such as page
numbers, grids and guides, and
graphic elements).
FROM WEB TO pRINTINg
InDesign allows you to have
control over your export settings,
from a high-quality print to a
lo-fi web version. You can also
establish bleeds, gutter and slug
dimensions. These are key if
you are printing a portfolio.
29

## Page 30

AUTO UpDATE pAgES
If you have an image that has
been modifi ed in another
program such as Illustrator or
Photoshop after it was placed in
InDesign, a small yellow triangle
warning sign will display in the
Links panel. Just click on the
yellow warning sign and the link
will update immediately. There
is no need to manually replace
images after you update them.
CHARACTER STYLES
Let’s say all of your titles need to
be a certain font, size and color.
You can set all of this information
in a Character Style Sheet and
then apply it to each title with
a click. Now, let’s say that you
decide that the titles are too small
and they all have to be made 4
points bigger. Just go to your
Character Sheet, modify the size

and everything associated with
that character style will update.
pACkAgE
After you’re done, you can
package your PDF and create a
single folder that contains all your
fonts, images, and linked fi les. This
makes backing up your work
super simple. Prefl ight also
ensures that there are no RGB

09 TYPOGRAPHY
TYpOgRApHY
It’s four in the morning, you’ve just tossed back a little bottle of Five Hour
Energy, and you’re thinking to yourself, “I need to pick a font. Everyone
else is using Helvetica/Futura/Univers…I want to be different. I want to
stand out. I know! I’ll use Curlz!”
Stop.
Right.
There.
Fonts are not a good way to differentiate yourself. Your work is. It may be
tempting to make a splashy page with crazy fonts, but unless you’ve thought it
over (and it still seems like a good idea when you’ve finally gotten some sleep),
then step back from the computer and settle down with your wild ideas. And
Curlz? What were you thinking? Go to bed.
The fonts you choose to use will dramatically affect your portfolio. One big
mistake that many portfolio newbies make is allowing your text to take away
from your work. Your type should be readable when important and nearly
fade into the background when it’s not essential. Typography is more than
just choosing a font; it is about making your information legible and readable
while still keeping an aesthetic layout. The following is a quick run-down of
the basics so you can avoid common mistakes. The more you know....

CHOOSINg A TYpEFACE
There are two families of typefaces:

has a short line or finishing stroke

typefaces are more traditional and
formal and are easier to read in a
Sans-Serif large block of text. Serifs help guide

attitude. There is display type, script,
hand-rendered type and more, but
for the purpose of a portfolio it is
best to stick to simple, clear, legible
typefaces. Here is a list of safe
typefaces to use when you just aren’t
sure, as well as a list of typefaces to
avoid at all costs!
gOOD FONTS
FONTS TO AVOID
Caution
Font ≠ Typeface: A typeface is the design/body of work of a character set. A font is the delivery
mechanism of those characters. If a typeface were a song, a font would be the MP3.

LEgIBILITY
The most important part of text is that it is readable. The typeface can
be perfect but if you can’t read it, perfection doesn’t matter. There are
many aspects to typography that affect the legibility of your text. First
there is the size- make sure the body text is not below 10pt. Next there
is the use of white space; you must let the type breathe. Leading is the
vertical spacing between lines of text. Proper leading keeps the reader’s
eye from losing its place between lines. It also affects the overall aesthetic
style of a page. Kerning is the spacing between individual characters
and tracking is the spacing between groups of characters- both affect
the flow of text. A readable page requires adequate contrast between
the text and background. For example, white text on a 30% gray
background is not very legible, but white text on 70% gray is clear.

09 TYPOGRAPHY
TExT LAYOUT
Alignment - Generally it is best to align text to the left because this is
the way we are used to reading (centered and right-aligned text can be
used in moderation). Justified text (when text is aligned to create straight
edges on both sides) can be used in moderation as well, but it can create
a rigid and unnatural feel with awkward spacing).
Measure - The length of a line of text (aka column width). The length
of the text affects the movement of the reader’s eye. If the length is
too long, the eye may be lost in the transition from line to line. If it is
too short, the reader’s eye may tire. A line of text is usually about 50
characters across and no more than 65 characters across.
Rag - The uneven vertical edge of a block of type. The rag affects the flow of
the reader’s eye, so try to avoid a shaggy rag.

STORYTELLINg
You have all your content. Now what do you do with all of it? How do you
organize it? Where do you begin? Storytelling can give you the structure
and the pizzazz to interest your reader.
Storytelling is a part of human nature. Throughout history and culture,
it has been the way we express our ideas in an appealing, organized
manner. Even the most basic of narrative structures use identifiable
beginnings, middles and endings.
With industrial design portfolios, there are many ways to go about explaining
your product, system, or service. One approach is to simply tell the story of
your solution, being sure to explain the full scope of how it works. The most
standard portfolio method uses the design process to explain how a solution
was found. For this reason, we’ve decided to focus on dissecting the typical
chronological order of the design process - problem statement, research,
ideation, validation/prototyping, and finalization - to tell a great story.
49

## Page 50

HOW DO YOU TELL A STORY?
It’s easy. Think of your portfolio as a conversation. The way you lay out your content helps direct that conversation.
We all have different ways we like to tell stories. Similarly, we all have different stories about our products. The
traditional method for storytelling is the chronological process. Conveniently, this is the same as the way we work
on our studio projects. There’s also the product manual method. This method is good for when you want to leave
out everything except the final solution. One other way to have your portfolio talk about you is to focus or highlight
on a particular set of skills. In the end, it’s up to you to choose a method that best fits your work. After all, this is
your story to tell, not ours.
HIgHLIgHT YOUR SkILL
“I kick ass at sketch renders.“
Sometimes, that’s all you want and
all you need to say. John Miller has
a portfolio that doesn’t fuss with the
confusing intricacies of a complex
process. His story focuses on his
skills, his attention to detail, and his
interest in electronics.

Another story you can tell will focus

someone that your product is real.
Oliver Muller’s portfolio takes a
page to highlight attention to feature
considerations, plus it shows he can
make a bad ass model.
51

## Page 52

CHRONOLOgICAL pROCESS
For simplicity’s sake, this is the story
we’re going to tell. Most portfolios
use this because a reader can clearly
understand how the designer arrived
at a final solution. By understanding
the beginning and middle processes
that connected to a final solution, the
reader can connect on a deeper level.
To put it simply, reading a novel
page by page is a lot easier to connect
to a story and a character in a novel
than jumping between chapters.

COVER pAgE/pROBLEM STATEMENT
It’s really important to explain your problem! Einstein once said “If I
had an hour to solve a problem, I’d spend 55 minutes thinking about
the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.” A cover page
or problem statement can set the tone of your project and hook
your reader. Use this as an opportunity to intrigue your potential
employers. It’s your fi rst chance to introduce the story of your
project, show how you think, and interest them in your solution.
Whether you state a problem, introduce a character, introduce an
important challenge, or even give the reader a visual sneak-peak of your
design, it’s up to you to decide what is most important.
Since ID portfolios are notorious for using rhetorical questions (and a
lot of employers have seen the same projects), make sure your problem
statement is unique. Hopefully you asked questions that are more
meaningful than “what could a bowling ball box look like?” One example
could be, “Using minimal cardboard, how can a box support the weight
of a bowling ball?” You could also introduce your problem by using
inspirational forms as criteria to inspire a bowling ball box.
SIMpLE ILLUSTRATIONS
This is an example of using
hierarchy to present a design
problem. The simple illustration
has the most visual presence on
the page, while the pink text
provides a greater understanding
of the topic without becoming
overwhelming. As a result, you
continue through this problem
statement with a clear takeaway.
STORY WITH STEpS
Renée does a really good job of
spreading the problem out and
presenting it in a clear, concise way.
The viewer gets a very clear picture
of the problem that he is trying to
solve through the use of very simple,
easily recognizable icons. There is
a hierarchy of text to support the
visual components.

14 RESEARCH
RESEARCH
Research offers a story about empathy. It is a tool to explain
what drove the opportunity in your design concept. Employers
value projects with empathy because it humanizes and
validates your product. At this stage in the game you really
want to show that you know the depth of the problem and
what you are going to focus on to solve it.
Showing research in a portfolio doesn’t mean that you bombard the
viewer with facts. Instead, you should highlight the issues that you
really honed in on to enhance your story. A lot of times using one
page to explain all of the key insights can be confusing, so utilize
storyboarding or lists to help break down your research.
Use research to highlight the way you think. The key findings or
questions you ask can be meaningful to employers.

INSpIRATION pAgES...
Inspiration pages are just that—a
way to show what inspired your
product. Don’t show too many
images. Showing only the best
examples (and pointing out what
makes them successful) can be much
more effective than a cluttered page
of dozens of objects.

the question is, how far apart can the objects be
before the illusion is lost?
25 26
... & OppORTUNITY SpACES
Plotting an array of competitive
products on a two-axis graph can
reveal market opportunities for
your product. In this example, the
designer compares competitors
based on two factors: how high- or
low-end they are (horizontal axis)
and how athletic or traditional
they appear (vertical axis). Plotting
the items this way revealed an
opportunity space in the upper-right
quadrant for a new quiver that is
both athletic and high-end.
Storytelling Tip
Remember who your audience is! Most industrial designers don’t like to read all your words, so make
sure your most important thoughts stick out quickly-whether it’s actually making description words
bigger, keeping it concise, or losing the wordy paragraphs!
58

## Page 59

14 RESEARCH
DATA HIERARCHY
When presenting statistical data,
remember to limit information
and use an effective hierarchy.
Too much information can bore
or intimidate the viewer. This
page is successful because the
designer calls out one piece of data
as being most important. Less
important, but still relevant, data
is represented in smaller graphs
and given less visual space.
MOOD BOARD
You may decide to include a mood
board to communicate the emotions
you want your design to convey. If
you do, don’t let it get too cluttered.
This board is successful because
each element is purposeful and has
room to breathe. In addition, the
environment in which the items
are placed contributes to the overall
“tone,” or feel, of the page.
TASk ANALYSIS
Is your product an evolution of
an existing product? If so, tell the
story of the current product. Here,
the designer shows the problems
involved with apprehending a
suspect with a pair of traditional
handcuffs. Problem areas should be
clearly identified to communicate
design opportunities (such as this
page, in magenta).
Storytelling Tip
Does it flow? If you can read a clear, understandable story by stringing the headers/biggest words on
your pages together, than you are in good shape!

15 bRAINSTORMING
BRAINSTORMINg
Brainstorming is representative of the nebulous beginning.
This is the part of the portfolio that some designers get
most excited about. Whether you love brainstorming or
not, it’s a vital part of the design process. There are always
new ways to approach this process, but just make sure
it’s conveyed in an understandable & meaningful way.
Brainstorming can start anywhere: mind mapping, sketching,
free association... anything that will help you get ideas down
on the page. If you choose to include your brainstorming phase
in your portfolio, don’t worry about how dumb the ideas might
appear. Rather, focus on communicating how your brainstorm
led to your best ideas and how you organized the chaos.
61

## Page 62

pOST-IT NOTES HELp
Post-it notes have become
an icon of the brainstom
process. Whenever possible
it’s recommended to pair your
words with a quick sketch on the
post-it. Using different colored
paper is a useful way of tracking
different types of information.
gRApH
Plotting on a graph gives your
data dimensions. Graphs are
commonly seen in portfolios and
are fairly easy to comprehend.
CATEgORIES
Post-its are easy to organize and
then reorganize into groups or
categories as you think through
your information. This type of
process may be better left for your
process book.
62

15 bRAINSTORMING
LINkS
While plotting your linked ideas
may be visually stunning, it
doesn’t say much more than “I
did this.” If linking ideas is key
to your design process, for the
sake of brevity, isolate them and
showcase them beautifully in your
portfolio.
WEB
Also visually stunning, yet
hard to comprehend. Focus on
a way of being able to distill
this activity and then feature
only the most insightful points
that led to your end result.

If it fits and it’s legible, put it in.
Make sure to highlight the key
points and make them stand out.

16 IDEATION
IDEATION
This is where you show how you think.
Many students make the mistake of simply covering pages
with sketches. Though your sketches may be beautiful, that’s
usually not the point. Rather, you want to communicate
your thought process. Always link your sketches back
to your initial problem and research, showing how you
worked towards solving the problems identified.
65

## Page 66

LINk YOUR RESEARCH...
...TO YOUR SkETCHES
In these two pages, the designer
links the key words from their
research to the sketches that they in-
spired. This is another great example
of hierarchy-making the key points
stand out by making the text larger
on the page.
THOUgHT pROCESS
The point of a sketch page is to
convey your thought process. Plac-
ing your ideas on a spectrum, or (in
this case) a two-axis chart, can show
what emotions you were attempting
to convey and how your sketches
worked towards those goals-ideally,
”moving towards the upper right.”
66

## Page 67

16 IDEATION
CONTExT!
Always show your concepts in
context - whether that context is a
hand, a leg, or anything else that can
help communicate scale and method
of use.
This page also does a good job of
“bucketing” features into boxes,
making it clear which sketches relate
to which.
kEY DESIgN pOINTS
Here, the designer calls out three
key points-- “recycled materials”,
“re-appropriated materials” and
“building materials.”
Loosely grouping sketches into these
three main categories helps commu-
nicate the designer’s intent.
ORTHOgRApHIC SkETCHES
Your sketches don’t have to be
3-D perspective drawings to
communicate your ideas well.
Here, the designer cleaned up
his 2-D orthographic drawings
and colored underneath them
in Photoshop to communicate
color and material choice.
Varying the size of objects also
helps draw the viewer’s eye
to more important ideas.

17 SKETCHES
SkETCHES
Well here it is, the thing most synonymous with the word designer:
sketches. You want them to look hot right?
All that time and commitment; they should look like diamonds
spilling from your page. This is all about capturing attention
and tantalizing the visual cortex. Spending time organizing your
sketches and making them pop will also help you understand how
to become a better sketcher.
69

## Page 70

THE SExY SkETCH pAgE
Making a good sketch page can be
a challenge, but there are still a few
guidelines that can help make your
composition more interesting.
Don’t be afraid to greatly vary
the sizes of sketches, making
your most important ideas the
largest. Letting a few sketches
hang off of the side of the page is
another great way to make your
composition more dynamic.
Overlapping sketches, like those
shown in the center, can help lead
the viewer’s eye around the page.
Adding shading and placing
shadows underneath your
objects can also help make
your sketches pop.
Be careful not to over-do it,
however. Sometimes, all it takes
is shading one or two sketches to
make a clear, understandable page.
Caution
Use this kind of page sparingly, if at all. Making a good ideation page means having more than hot
sketches. Employers really want to see how you think, and doing that effectively means arranging your
ideas in a way that communicates a hierarchy of importance. Using call outs is another way to let the
viewer know what you were thinking without you there to talk about it.
70

## Page 71

17 SKETCHES
THE NOT-SO-SExY
SkETCH pAgE
This page illustrates common
mistakes some beginners make
on their early sketch pages.
There is not a single sketch here that
breaks the edge of the page, making
the composition appear very static.
In addition, the lack of scale
variation reduces overall
visual interest and increases
confusion, as the viewer has little
indication of which sketches
should be viewed first.

VALIDATION
“If at first you don’t succeed try, try again” is the mantra for the
validation phase and is a very important part of storytelling. This is
the meat and potatoes of design process, where employers get to see
which of your concepts worked…and which concepts didn’t.
Nobody’s design is perfect on the first shot, so don’t be afraid to
show your mistakes. Mistakes lead to further developments and
help you discover how you can improve your designs. Be sure to
document EVERYTHING, including those really quick pink
foam models. You aren’t going to be keeping those under your bed
forever and even if you do, they’re sure to get crushed. Show off
your crappy, cobbled-together sketch models. They are rich with
information and are as valuable (if not more) to the design process
as having really hot sketches.

illustrate that you have an
understanding of how a product
will be used in its intended
environment. They will further
communicate the design of the
product by showing scale.
WORkS IN pROgRESS
Show, don’t tell. An intriguing
photo of a project in the works
will let your viewer know the
project is in progress and is on
its way to further refi nement.
CHANgE IN DIRECTION
Pages like this are useful if you
discover that your concepts
really miss the mark. Instead of
disregarding all of the hard work
that you did up to this point, this
page marks a change in direction
and demonstrates your ability to
realize your faults, regroup, and take
a different approach.
Pages like this also act as a good
segue. Instead of throwing your
viewers a curve ball, you are
letting them know you went back
to the drawing board.

19 FINALIZATION
FINALIZATION
Finally! You’ve introduced your audience to your design problem,
taken them through the research, shown them how that research
evolved into ideas that you validated and tested - now it’s time to
present the final concept.
In its simplest form, the finalization phase in your portfolio is the
chance to show off your final design. A “money shot”-usually kept
on its own page-conveys the emotional pull of your design. Follow
it with a few pages explaining your product’s functionality and
show how it integrates with the lives of potential users.
You can show a few more things depending on what skills you
want to communicate. Showing how you modeled, sanded, and
painted the final prototype would be vital if you hope to find a co-
op in a model shop doing similar work, for example.
But don’t take our word for it! Use your designer’s intuition to
help yourself decide what parts of the process to show and
what parts aren’t so important. Be creative and have fun with it.
81

THE MONEY SHOT
The simplest part of your
finalization page(s) will be the
glamour shot, or “money shot.”
Don’t be afraid to let it take up
a good part of the page, or even
go over the edge of the paper.
This page is especially effective
because the designer included hands
to show scale and method of use.
ExpLODED VIEWS
Exploded views are cool. Not every
project needs one, however.
If your exploded view is concise and
shows you’ve been thinking about
how it all fits together, include it.
In this example, the designer shows
how the handle of his “jaws of life”
(shown above) work. By show-
ing only one small element of the
product, visual clutter is erased and
the overall message of functionality
is enhanced.

...TO YOUR FINAL pRODUCT
These two great pages show
THE MONEY SHOT what objects and forms
inspired the final concept.
Linking the final concepts directly
back to those forms - and speak-
ing about how they contributed to
the design - can make a lot of sense
out of what is usually a mystery.
ExpLODED VIEWS pRIORITIZE FEATURES
When communicating your prod-
uct’s features, always remember to
prioritize (hierarchy!).
Here, the designer wanted to
communicate the folding element of
the design first and foremost, while
he subordinated the other features
by making them smaller.

THE STEp-BY-STEp
Products are meant to
be used-show it!
Showing a simple step-by-step
(remember, less is more) can be
a great way to show off your
clever interaction ideas.
SkETCH RENDERS
if you’re presenting a smaller project,
don’t feel like your fi nalization pages
have to show a 3-D model.
If you’re adept at sketching and
Photoshop rendering, this is a great
place to show off those skills.
pHYSICAL pROTOTYpINg
Did your project involve making a
fi nal physical prototype? This is the
place to show your model-making
process, if you wish.
Be careful not to show too much.
This page is successful because the
photos are clear, the subjects fi ll
the frames (crop!), and each photo
shows a different skill.
Quick Tip
Thumbnail! One of the easiest ways to work through your portfolio’s layout is to sketch out
thumbnails. No computer or Wacom necessary, just grab a pen and start drawing out some miniature
boxes to use as your pages. You can quickly throw around layout concepts this way.
84

19 FINALIZATION
THAT’S A WRAp
Developing a portfolio is like telling a story. It may be a struggle for you to
decide what to include, so ask yourself “What am I trying to say about my
process?” or “How does this contribute to my story?”
Everyone has their own way of thinking about things. The way you tell your
story indicates whether or not you are a good fit for a company. The purpose
of creating your portfolio is to get yourself a job that caters to your strengths,
not to overwhelm you with the amount of work you need to improve.
Celebrate your own design sense and what you bring to the table. Tell your
story and make sure it has future employers sitting on the edge of their seats,
wondering what comes next.

ASkINg FOR ADVICE
Sometimes the best ideas come from people that aren’t you. So don’t be
scared, go out there and learn from the upperclassmen, your professors,
ask your previous coworkers, even ask your classmates. Obviously, they
have opinions!
Organizing a personal meeting to evaluate your portfolio can be useful. Sit
down or ask them to evaluate each page, to understand if you are conveying a
successful message, and what you could do better. Don’t forget to write what
they say down, their knowledge is valuable and could help you get that next
job you want. This could take some time, so maybe offer to get a
coffee with them!
If you can start a conversation with them, you can understand what
isn’t working in your portfolio, learn from their previous mistakes, and
hear about their work experience. Just remember, they were once in
your shoes and probably can relate at some point to crying at 4 in the
morning.

DAN CLIFTON
UCID’09 @ NEW DEAL DESIgN
The main disadvantage of
being a young designer is lack
of experience. You lack not
only technical design skills
but also an understanding of
and exposure to good design.
Most sophomores don’t really
get design yet. The more you
are exposed to good design,
the sooner things will click.
Students should have knowledge of
modern designers and their work.
You may know the classics like
Eames and Frank Lloyd Wright,
but do you know who is at the
forefront of design today? I know
this is not the easiest or fastest thing
for students to learn - especially
when you are still learning the basics
of design - but this exposure can
help jump start the development
of your design sensibilities.
Students should be reading blogs
and magazines like crazy. Soak up
as much knowledge as possible.
Not only do these sources provide a
picture of design today, but they’re
also a huge source of inspiration.

Portfolios are a bitch to make.
At it’s basest level, a portfolio is a collection of work you’ve
completed. At it’s loftiest, a portfolio is a visual representation of
your thought processes. It’s your face to the world and it had better
be a good one. Portfolios are one of the most stress-inducing aspects
of your design life right now (and they rightly should be).
A portfolio gets you a job, and that job gets you experience, and
that experience will make your portfolio better and better. It’s
a cycle that all starts right now, with your first portfolio.
Now...before you go and jump off the roof in utter exasperation, remember
that portfolios are never good on the first go-round. Whether you’re a
sophomore or a professional with 25 years of experience, it’s going to suck the
first time you sit down and start hashing out your next draft. That’s OK. Right
now, you’re surrounded by people who may be competing with you for jobs,
but we are all actually pulling for each other. That’s the joy of a design studio.
You’ve made a portfolio and you may think it looks pretty good, great
even, but show it to any one of your fellow ID students and they’ll pick
holes in it like moth in a wool coat. It’s not out of malevolence, but, just
like your mom harping on you to stand up straight, it’s for your own
good. Talk to everyone you can about your portfolio, and actually listen
to their advice. You’re going to get quite a bit of conflicting input but
eventually you’ll be able to condense the critiques into actionable items
to change. Look at and critique other people’s portfolios, too. Find out
what you really love in someone else’s portfolio and do it in your own.
The more you develop the language of portfolios and critiques, the better
you will become at expressing design intents in your own portfolio.
So there you have it, just about everything we know about crafting
a portfolio. Think of this as an overall guide, and send us your stuff.
We’ll want to see it and we’re all a bunch of opinionated hooligans
who will tell you what we think. Our degree is only worth as much
as the following graduating classes make it worth. Be better than
those who came before you. Build on our experience. Learn from
our mistakes and from our successes. Be honest with your studio
mates, watch out for each other, demand the best from everyone
around you, and never take the easy way out. Portfolios tell your
story, but we’re all here to make sure that the story is a good one.

THANk YOU, WE LOVE YOU
We’d like to shout out special thanks to the
people who made this book possible:
Mike Roller assigned this book as a project in his Design Communica-
tions class. Without his enthusiasm for improving the design community,
this book wouldn’t have been possible. Special thanks to Mike Roller.
Darrin Hunter generously allowed us to use his examples of
resume makeovers and gave us some much-needed
graphic design feedback. Special thanks to Darrin Hunter.
Design Professionals provided invaluable insights into their experi-
ences with creating and evaluating portfolios. They offered great
advice supported by years of experience. Special thanks to:
Rachel Kroft, Chris Witham, John Murphy, Bryan Hammer,
Richard Kuchinsky, Tom Pelzer, Jacob Ballard, John Turner,
Jaime Sanchez, Julius Tarng, Doug Laib, Marnie Meylor, and
everyone else who gave us their thoughts and advice.
Recent UCID alums wrote “Wisdom from Above,” offering re-
latable advice and perspectives. Special thanks to Jince
Kuruvilla, Ming Hsieh, Kristen Beck, and Dan Clifton.

WE WANT TO HELP.
PORTFOLIOS ARE A BITCH TO MAKE.
That’s why we wanted to help. It’s been a while since we
were sophomores, but we never forgot the emotional roller
coaster of trying to get our first job (we still go through it).
Looking back, we wish we would have known what we
know now. This book is for you: a collection of our knowl-
edge passed down to you in the hopes that you become
better designers, better professionals, and better people.
